## Requirements for Final Presentation Video

● 9-12 (in exceptional cases 15) minutes long

#### Five parts:

1. Demo of main scenario - played alongside story (eventually show also quick p2p request/transfer
here – if not integrated in next demo)

2. Demo of "special"/"unique"/”distinguished” feature - played alongside brief other story
(1 and 2 can be merged into one big story if this works better. If time, there can be also 3 scenarios
presented)

3. Core architecture (data model and maybe components)

4. Technical challenges (and hint at their solutions) and solutions/used technologies/ mastery of the
team

5. Finish: Short role of each member, one reason why your solution is the best solution

- There is no requirement on the number of presenters in the movie (it would be though good
to see more than one real person playing through the scenarios)

- Need playable link to video presentation before lecture – also link in final project repository
