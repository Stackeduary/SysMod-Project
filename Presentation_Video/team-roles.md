Virtually everybody was involved in the actual development of the app in one way or another except for Bill. But our team wouldn't be nearly as strong as it was without the contributions of the following people:


#### MVPs:

- <b>Adil</b>: product owner with Bill and tech lead; ran most of our bi-weekly meetings and provided a product vision along with a development vision; kept back end developers on task.

- <b>Pabasara</b>: architecture owner with Kamil; built our entire project infrastructure herself; was one of the leaders of the back end development team.

- <b>Jason</b>: built the front end virtually single-handedly. Was the main liaison between the back end team and the front end team, along with Adil. Also was a scrum master along with Matin.
