#### Our open bank is called KaiBank.

Kai means "open" in Mandarin, and KaiBank is truly an open source bank. It is the world's first no-fee bank. Deposits, withdrawals, transfers--all transactions are free for our customers.

#### This document summarizes the architecture of KaiBank.

Our first task toward defining the architecture of KaiBank was to hold an event storming session. 

![event storming diagram](resources/event-storming-diagram.jpg)

The entire diagram can be found [here](https://miro.com/app/board/o9J_ljct2SI=/)

Our next task was to begin writing user stories for KaiBank. This was very much an iterative process where we would envision the features of KaiBank, write user stories to capture those features, create a backlog to begin developing those features, and then go back and modify our user stories to fit our refined and enhanced vision.

A full list of user stories is located [here](user-stories.md).

Our main users are:

- Johan Johansson, KaiBank admin
- Mike Russell, KaiBank customer service representative
- Jesse Smalls, KaiBank customer

Full user personas can be found [here](architecture_report/user-personas.md).

The architecture of KaiBank became clearer after the event storming session and our initial set of user stories were written. Our architecture owners then began working on the class diagram for KaiBank before any development took place.

# note for architecture report authors: must somehow tie in the fact that KaiBank utilizes a model-view-controller architecture. 

# note for architecture report authors: must also mention bi-directional referential integrity 

The next step was to create use case diagrams and sequence diagrams are based on our user stories. For the sake of convenience, we list the user story followed by the use case diagram and sequence diagram representing that user story. Some user stories have multiple permutations. See [this list](user-stories.md) for a detailed view.
